# **Retrieval-Augmented-Generation**



**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) is a fundamental technique that enhances the responses generated by Large 
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating their knowledge with external information. This is particularly useful in contexts 
where relevant information resides in internal documents, such as policies or training manuals.

In this project, we explore how to implement a basic RAG system that can allows companies to access and utilize their internal 
documents to generate more accurate and contextual responses. By doing so, we improve user experience and increase 
confidence in the solutions provided by artificial intelligence.

For a more detailed explanation of the RAG technique and its implementation, I invite you to read my article on Medium: 
[How to Make a RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Python](https://cristianfdev.medium.com/how-to-make-a-rag-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-python-e23b1e4d3dee).
